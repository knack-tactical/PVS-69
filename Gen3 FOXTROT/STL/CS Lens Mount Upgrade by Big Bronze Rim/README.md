These files are an upgrade to the CS Lens Mount files for the Gen3 FOXTROT.
 - CS_Focus_Insert
    - This slots into the camera hole of the Gen3 FOXTROT Ambi Tube.
 - CS_Tapered_Retaining_Collar
    - This uses a screw to affix it to the lens so that it rotates when the lens body is spun to allow it to engage against the CS_Focus_Insert.
    - It uses the CS_Lens_Mount_Retainer, which just needs to be loosened to change the focus.
 - PVS14_Focus_Ring_Outer
    - This acts the same as the CS_Lens_Mount_Shroud.stl, but is a bit larger.
 - Ribbed_CS_Spacer
    - This is functionally the same as the CS_Lens_Mount_Adapter.stl, but is ribbed for aesthetics.
