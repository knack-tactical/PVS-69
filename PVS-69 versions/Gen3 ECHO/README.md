# PVS-69 Gen3 ECHO

### This design requires the following printed components: 

1x [Dovetail](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/blob/main/PVS-69%20versions/Gen3%20ECHO/STL/Dovetail.stl)

1x Bridge. In this design, there are 3 Bridge options:
1. [Gen3 Bridge](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/blob/main/PVS-69%20versions/Gen3%20ECHO/STL/Gen3%20bridge%20body.stl) is the same bridge as older versions, with an internal battery compartment.
2. [Gen4 Bridge Back-Load](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/blob/main/PVS-69%20versions/Gen3%20ECHO/STL/Gen4%20bridge%20back-load%20body.stl) is a newer, sleeker bridge that does *not* have an internal battery compartment. The back-loading version allows the user to more easily build the internals of the bridge and then load it into the back (away from your face).
3. [Gen4 Bridge Front-Load](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/blob/main/PVS-69%20versions/Gen3%20ECHO/STL/Gen4%20bridge%20front-load%20body.stl) is the same as above, except it is accessed from the front (towards your face).

1x Bridge Backplate, which will depend on the Bridge body you choose

2x [Sensor Caps](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/blob/main/PVS-69%20versions/Gen3%20ECHO/STL/RunCam%20sensor%20cap.stl)

2x TIPs (Tube Intergace Pieces) - please note there are [+0°](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/blob/main/PVS-69%20versions/Gen3%20ECHO/STL/%2B0%20TIP.stl) and [+2°](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/tree/main/PVS-69%20versions/Gen3%20ECHO/STL) versions. 
    The +2° version gives a wider FOV

2x [Ambi Tubes](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/blob/main/PVS-69%20versions/Gen3%20ECHO/STL/Ambi%20tube%20-%20ECHO%20.stl)

1x [Battery Cap](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/blob/main/PVS-69%20versions/Gen3%20ECHO/STL/Battery%20cap.stl) (Only needed if using Gen3 Bridge)

2x [Collars](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/blob/main/PVS-69%20versions/Gen3%20ECHO/STL/Collar.stl)


### For physical components you will need the following:

11x M5x7 heat set insert

11x M5x8 bolts (for the dovetail, a button head screw is reccomend) 

2x RunCam Night Eagle 3

2x V760A-5 or V760A-3 displays. These can be found on Ebay or AliExpress, expect a month for shipping

1x 3-position rotary switch. I use "Rotary Switch 16MM Selector Switch 3 Position Select Switch"
this can be found on Amazon sold in a 2 pack

1x 300x8mm OD of brass tubing. you will only use 100mm

1x 5.5x2.1mm DC female jack. This can also be found on Amazon. I used the plastic ones sold in a 5 pack

1x AA battery terminals. these are sold in a 20 pack

1x Buck Converter. I used the eBoot Mini MP1584EN DC-DC Buck Converter Adjustable Power Supply Module (6 Pack) 

2x 10x2mm Nitrile Oring

2x 13x3mm Nitrile Oring

5x 22x2mm Nitrile Oring (you can buy a multipack that has all three sizes)

You will also need aproximately 24" of 20-24 AWG wire, we recommend black and red.
