PVS-69 GEN3 Delta. 

This design requires the following printed components: 

1x Dovetail

1x Bridge

2x Sensor caps (foxeer or runcam)please note there are +0 and +2. 
I prefer using the +2 as it wides fov and gives me a better view of the tube.

1x right tube

1x left tube or a DVR tube. 

1x Battery cover

1x Backplate.


For physical components you will need the following

11x M5x7 heat set insert

11x M5x8 bolts. (for the dovetail a button head is reccomend) 

2x Starlight FPV cameras. Runcam or Foxeer work in this design.

2x V760A-5 or V760A-3 displays. These can be found on Ebay or AliExpress, expect a month for shipping

1x 3 position rotary switch. I use "Rotary Switch 16MM Selector Switch 3 Position Select Switch"
this can be found on Amazon sold in a 2 pack

1x 300x8mm OD of brass tubing. you will only use 100mm

1x 5.5x2.1mm DC female jack. This can also be found on Amazon. I used the plastic ones sold in a 5 pack

1x AA battery terminals. these are sold in a 20 pack

1x Buck Converter. I used the eBoot Mini MP1584EN DC-DC Buck Converter Adjustable Power Supply Module (6 Pack) 

2x 10mmx2mm Nitrile Oring

2x 13mmx3mm Nitrile Oring

5x 22x2mm Nitrile Oring (you can buy a multipack that has all three sizes)

1x 2x8mm rare earth magnet

you will also need aproximately 24" of wire, I recommend black and red. 



OPTIONALLY

6x Rare earth magnets 2mmx8mm diameter

2x .5A reed switches. 

2x 2N7000 mosfets.
