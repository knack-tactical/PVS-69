## What is it?
PVS-69 is a FOSSCAD Monocular Night Vision Device (MNVD). 
It uses a camera and small screen, rather than a phosphor tube, and is designed to be mounted to a combat helmet.

## Why is it useful?
The current suggested components cost ~$400, about 10x less than the industry standard phosphor tube-based version.
